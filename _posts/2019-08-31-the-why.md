My goals with this blog is to better formalize what I have learned at work and in life. Even though I think there is nothing special about myself, I believe keeping a public record of lessons learned will help me consolidate some knowledge.

Hopefully, this exercise will in time create content that may be useful for someone. It that happens it is a bonus and will make me really happy.

Therefore, my goals are:

- Better formalize professional and live lessons.
- Became a better person.
- All that to help my peers and society, even it just a little bit.
