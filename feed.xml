Even though I think there is nothing special about myself, I believe keeping a public record of lessons learned will help me consolidate some knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, this exercise will in time create content that may be useful for someone. It that happens it is a bonus and will make me really happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, my goals are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Better formalize professional and live lessons.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Became a better person.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All that to help my peers and society, even it just a little bit.&lt;/li&gt;
